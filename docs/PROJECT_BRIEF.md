# Advanced Migration Tool - Project Brief

## What is this project?

The **Advanced Migration Tool** is a Joomla extension that helps website owners migrate their content from other content management systems (like WordPress) into Joomla.

## Why was this built?

Many people want to switch their websites to Joomla but find it difficult to move their existing content (articles, images, users, categories) from their current platform. This tool automates that process, making it much easier and faster than doing it manually.

### Problems it solves:
- **Manual migration is tedious**: Copying articles, categories, and media files one by one takes forever
- **Content format differences**: Different platforms store content differently
- **Media file headaches**: Images and files need to be downloaded and reorganized
- **User and permission mapping**: Preserving authors and access levels during migration
- **Error handling**: Things go wrong during migration, and you need to know what happened

## What can it do?

### Core Features:
- **Import from WordPress**: Upload WordPress export files (WXR/XML format) and convert them to Joomla
- **Import from JSON**: Support for generic JSON-formatted content exports
- **Smart media migration**: Automatically download images and files from your old site via FTP/SFTP or ZIP upload
- **User migration**: Preserve article authors and user accounts
- **Category mapping**: Keep your content organization intact
- **Progress tracking**: See real-time status during long migrations
- **Error logging**: Detailed logs when something goes wrong
- **Transaction safety**: If migration fails, your Joomla site stays clean

### Media Migration Options:
- **FTP/FTPS/SFTP**: Connect directly to your old server to download media files
- **ZIP Upload**: Upload a ZIP file containing all your media files
- **Flexible storage**: Choose where to store migrated files in your Joomla media folder

## How does it work?

The tool follows a simple 3-step process:

1. **Upload**: You upload an export file from your old CMS (like a WordPress XML export)
2. **Configure**: Set up media migration options if you want to transfer images and files
3. **Import**: The tool processes everything automatically and shows you the progress

Behind the scenes, it:
- Parses your export file to understand the content structure
- Converts content to Joomla's format
- Downloads and organizes media files
- Creates articles, categories, and users in your Joomla database
- Maps relationships between content elements

## Technical Overview

- **PHP 7.4+**: Core programming language
- **Joomla 4+ Framework**: Built as native Joomla component and plugins
